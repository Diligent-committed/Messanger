# Messanger class 
Will and Will

The goals of this project are to practice using: 
* Github 
* Classes 

Our plan: 
the three messanger classes we want: 
* morse code 
* numerical values for letters

The project as a whole: Will and I made three different messaging systmes (Will G did two and I did one). There is pig latin, morse code and there is a code which changed the message imputted to numbers. Will G made the antiq and his messanger file and I made my own messanger file that I then called as a class in the antiq file Will G had made. 
Will G was able to do a lot of the work much quicker than I was able to have done. Working together made it interesting, but I also think because Will G is a much better coder than i am he was able to do most of the homework without me getting to it. I think I would have been able to do the project alone (it would have taken more time), but Will G made it easier for me to be able to just add what I had done to his main code. Github was interesting to use... I did not like how i could access the repository without going through the organization at first and ended up trying to branch the repository so I could make a local folder. I think overall it worked out well, I would have liked to have put more forward but I was (as I usually am) a little behind in coding experience and execution. 

Will G:
The project was fairly simple, and it was fun to work with cyphers. I worked on morse code, and on a whim also coded pig latin, as well as the main runner. Morse encoding and decoding works with two dictionaries, and piglatin just uses an algorithm. I spent about half an hour with some friends talking about decoding pig latin, but we decided that because the number of letters moved to the end is uncertain, decoding pig latin without either a large number of errors or checking against a large number of common words would be almost impossible. Github was ok for most of it, but when it came to finalizing the code, there were some discrepencies that I almost missed. On the whole though, it was a fun project.
