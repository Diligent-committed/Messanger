# Messanger class 
Will and Will

The goals of this project are to practice using: 
* Github 
* Classes 

Our plan: 
the three messanger classes we want: 
* morse code 
* numerical values for letters

The project as a whole: Will and I made three different messaging systmes (Will G did two and I did one). There is pig latin, morse code and there is a code which changed the message imputted to numbers. Will G made the antiq and his messanger file and I made my own messanger file that I then called as a class in the antiq file Will G had made. 
Will G was able to do a lot of the work much quicker than I was able to have done. Working together made it interesting, but I also think because Will G is a much better coder than i am he was able to do most of the homework without me getting to it. I think I would have been able to do the project alone (it would have taken more time), but Will G made it easier for me to be able to just add what I had done to his main code. Github was interesting to use... I did not like how i could access the repository without going through the organization at first and ended up trying to branch the repository so I could make a local folder. I think overall it worked out well, I would have liked to have put more forward but I was (as I usually am) a little behind in coding experience and execution.
